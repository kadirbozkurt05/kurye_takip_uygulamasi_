# Android Application for Small Business Owners with Courier Tracking

This Android application is designed to cater to small business owners, providing them with the capability to track their couriers in real-time. When a client signs up, they can add couriers as workers and monitor their location during working hours. Although an early project, it serves as a foundation for businesses seeking efficient courier management solutions.

## Features:
- **Live Courier Tracking**: Business owners can track their couriers' locations in real-time, ensuring efficient management of deliveries.
- **Worker Management**: Clients can add couriers as workers within the application, facilitating seamless tracking during working hours.
- **Ease of Use**: The app is designed with simplicity in mind, ensuring that users can navigate through its features effortlessly.
- **Firebase Integration**: Utilizes Firebase for backend services, ensuring secure data storage and seamless synchronization across devices.
  

## Technologies Used:
- **JAVA**: Primary programming language used for Android app development, providing flexibility and compatibility with the Android platform.
- **Android Studio**: Integrated development environment (IDE) used for building, testing, and debugging the Android application.
- **Firebase**: Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform utilized for authentication, database management, and cloud storage, facilitating seamless data management and synchronization.

This project represents an early attempt at addressing the courier tracking needs of small business owners. Because it was a learning project for me, it has some deficiencies. It is not on Play Store because of some policy issues.
